      "I have been fortunate enough to use the Fairy Tale STEM kits in my classroom as well as the STEM journals, which my students really enjoyed.  I would love to implement more of the Lakeshore STEM kits in my classroom for the next school year as they provide excellent and engaging STEM lessons.My students come from a variety of backgrounds, including language and socioeconomic status.  Many of them don't have a lot of experience in science and engineering and these kits give me the materials to provide these exciting opportunities for my students.Each month I try to do several science or STEM/STEAM projects.  I would use the kits and robot to help guide my science instruction in engaging and meaningful ways.  I can adapt the kits to my current language arts pacing guide where we already teach some of the material in the kits like tall tales (Paul Bunyan) or Johnny Appleseed.  The following units will be taught in the next school year where I will implement these kits: magnets, motion, sink vs. float, robots.  I often get to these units and don't know If I am teaching the right way or using the right materials.    The kits will give me additional ideas, strategies, and lessons to prepare my students in science.It is challenging to develop high quality science activities.  These kits give me the materials I need to provide my students with science activities that will go along with the curriculum in my classroom.  Although I have some things (like magnets) in my classroom, I don't know how to use them effectively.  The kits will provide me with the right amount of materials and show me how to use them in an appropriate way.\n",

      "I teach high school English to students with learning and behavioral disabilities. My students all vary in their ability level. However, the ultimate goal is to increase all students literacy levels. This includes their reading, writing, and communication levels.I teach a really dynamic group of students. However, my students face a lot of challenges. My students all live in poverty and in a dangerous neighborhood. Despite these challenges, I have students who have the the desire to defeat these challenges. My students all have learning disabilities and currently all are performing below grade level. My students are visual learners and will benefit from a classroom that fulfills their preferred learning style.The materials I am requesting will allow my students to be prepared for the classroom with the necessary supplies.  Too often I am challenged with students who come to school unprepared for class due to economic challenges.  I want my students to be able to focus on learning and not how they will be able to get school supplies.  The supplies will last all year.  Students will be able to complete written assignments and maintain a classroom journal.  The chart paper will be used to make learning more visual in class and to create posters to aid students in their learning.  The students have access to a classroom printer.  The toner will be used to print student work that is completed on the classroom Chromebooks.I want to try and remove all barriers for the students learning and create opportunities for learning. One of the biggest barriers is the students not having the resources to get pens, paper, and folders. My students will be able to increase their literacy skills because of this project.\n",

      "\\\"Life moves pretty fast. If you don't stop and look around once in awhile, you could miss it.\\\"  from the movie, Ferris Bueller's Day Off.  Think back...what do you remember about your grandparents?  How amazing would it be to be able to flip through a book to see a day in their lives?My second graders are voracious readers! They love to read both fiction and nonfiction books.  Their favorite characters include Pete the Cat, Fly Guy, Piggie and Elephant, and Mercy Watson. They also love to read about insects, space and plants. My students are hungry bookworms! My students are eager to learn and read about the world around them. My kids love to be at school and are like little sponges absorbing everything around them. Their parents work long hours and usually do not see their children. My students are usually cared for by their grandparents or a family friend. Most of my students do not have someone who speaks English at home. Thus it is difficult for my students to acquire language.Now think forward... wouldn't it mean a lot to your kids, nieces or nephews or grandchildren, to be able to see a day in your life today 30 years from now? Memories are so precious to us and being able to share these memories with future generations will be a rewarding experience.  As part of our social studies curriculum, students will be learning about changes over time.  Students will be studying photos to learn about how their community has changed over time.  In particular, we will look at photos to study how the land, buildings, clothing, and schools have changed over time.  As a culminating activity, my students will capture a slice of their history and preserve it through scrap booking. Key important events in their young lives will be documented with the date, location, and names.   Students will be using photos from home and from school to create their second grade memories.   Their scrap books will preserve their unique stories for future generations to enjoy.Your donation to this project will provide my second graders with an opportunity to learn about social studies in a fun and creative manner.  Through their scrapbooks, children will share their story with others and have a historical document for the rest of their lives.\n",

      "Some of my students come from difficult family lives, but they don't let that stop them. We have built a community in our classroom that allows each student to be comfortable with who they are. Even though we are a diverse school, everyone feels included. We have a high Hispanic population, and about 90% of the students are on free or reduced-price lunch. Most students are living with a single parent or both parents work full time, although many parents are eager to help in any way they can.\\r\\nWe all know how important it is to get kids up and moving. I want my classroom to be a place where students can be active phyically and mentally. The requested items will allow my students to move all day. When they are sitting in a chair, their movement is limited.\\r\\n       Kindergarten students have a hard time sitting still for long periods of time. They would much rather bounce on a stability ball or wiggle on a cushion than sit in a hard chair. Having these choices in my classroom will allow students to be active and learn at the same time. \\r\\n        Having these choices in my classroom will also build a greater bond between the students.  They will learn to choose which seat best fits their learning style, and hopefully they will be able to help their classmates find a seat that works for them.

      "\\\"This is how mathematicians do it! Remember we are all mathematicians in this classroom!\\\" A few simple words repeated regularly-words that instill a sense of pride in each of my students!\\r\\n\\r\\nI am proud to teach math in rural Alabama where our Title I school has both administrator and parental support.\\r\\nThis sense of community pride has been instilled in the students. It is visible in the respect they give both faculty and visitors to our campus. It is apparent in their love of learning. Our parents want the best for their children, but many of them, due to their own economic concerns, can offer very little in the way of anything more than just the basics. Many of our students live in homes without computers or Internet access. I feel that due to the socioeconomic status of many of my students it is my job to level the playing field as much as possible so that my students will have the same learning opportunities as other students and will be able to compete in the global market.Many of my students come from low socioeconomic homes. These homes have little in the way of hands on toys. In addition, even those from affluent backgrounds, are more interested in electronics  than \\\"old fashion\\\" toys. As a result, more and more students, find measurement- especially area, a very abstract concept!\\r\\n  Building bricks would provide students a hands on opportunity to explore measurement and area in an engaging way! Not only would students be able to explore measurement, but also to learn more about the real world skills of designing and building structures. It would also encourage teamwork and problem solving as students developed an idea and then worked to implement their idea.\\r\\n   How exciting would it be for students to have the opportunity to not only learn so much, but to also have fun through such a simple items as building bricks!\\r\\nnannan\n",

      "Some of my students come from difficult family lives but they do not let that stop them We have built a community in our classroom that allows each student to be comfortable with who they are Even though we are a diverse school everyone feels included We have a high Hispanic population and about 90 of the students are on free or reduced price lunch Most students are living with a single parent or both parents work full time although many parents are eager to help in any way they can We all know how important it is to get kids up and moving I want my classroom to be a place where students can be active phyically and mentally The requested items will allow my students to move all day When they are sitting in a chair their movement is limited Kindergarten students have a hard time sitting still for long periods of time They would much rather bounce on a stability ball or wiggle on a cushion than sit in a hard chair Having these choices in my classroom will allow students to be active and learn at the same time Having these choices in my classroom will also build a greater bond between the students They will learn to choose which seat best fits their learning style and hopefully they will be able to help their classmates find a seat that works for them As the students move around the room they will be able to work with everyone instead of being with one group each day nannan\n"
